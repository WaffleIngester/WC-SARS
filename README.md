# WC-SARS

WC-SARS is a program which acts as a gameserver for the video game [Super Animal Royale](https://animalroyale.com "Super Animal Royale website"). If you haven't played it before, then you should give it a try.

Many features are mising and may or may not be added in the future.

# Required Files
There are a few important files required for the program to run. Some are found in the same location as the `WC-SARS.exe` executable, while others are found in a subfolder of this location known as `datafiles`. If this folder doesn't exist, you can simply create in in the correct location and place the files within.

## Server Config
*NOTE: `server-config.txt` must be placed in the same folder as `WC-SARS.exe`.*
(this file is auto-generated if it's not found)

Properties that the Match's the program makes, will use. Some are required, such as `server-ip`, while others like `drink-rate` are for you to mess around if you wish.

Config generation is currently a bit wonky. If a key is not found then the default values is used. However the key won't get written back to the file again, so be cautious.

# Final Notes
While the "Master" branch is mostly stable, bugs still creep in. If you want the latest changes please compile "test1" instead. As this branch will likely have fixes already for new features; along with the new features being added.
