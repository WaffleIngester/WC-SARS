# WC-SARS.Replay

WC-SARS is a program which mimics the v0.90.2 gameservers for the game "Super Animal Royale."

This branch was for messing with a "replay" system. Just proving that it *can* work if more effort is put into it.

# Required Files
There's several files required to run. You'd have to check the main branch for that information though. It's pretty much the same thing.

# Final Comments
This branch is more of a proof-of-concept rather than an actively developed branch.

Replays may be added to the main branch at a later date if the program is in a good-enough state to start doing this sort of stuff.
If anyone wants to mess with this go ahead; but more than likely updates from the main aren't coming here anytime soon.
