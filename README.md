# WC-SARS

WC-SARS is a program which acts as a gameserver for the video game [Super Animal Royale](https://animalroyale.com "Super Animal Royale website"). If you haven't played it before, then you should give it a try.

Many features are mising and may or may not be added in the future.

# Required Files
There are a few files required for the program to run properly. Some of these can be found in the same location as the `WC-SARS` executable; however, others are found in a subfolder of this location: `datafiles`. If the `datafiles` directory does not exist, you can simply create it yourself in the correct spot, and place the missing files you need within that newly created folder (assuming you even have the files in the first place!).

For simplicity sake, the require files section is collapsed. If you wish to read more then click the text below to expand.

# Final Comments
While the master branch is *supposed* to be stable, there may be some issues still. If you want the latest changes go to the "test1" branch instead. Some bugs from the latest-added features are probably-maybe fixed there. Also also! If you want to contribute that helps too!
