    -- Changelog --  

+------------------------------------------------------
	-- 2/19/23 --

Match:
	>> Overall team-based modes *should* work. Can't find people to test it out concistently; so if something's broken don't be too surprised.
	>> Super Skunk Gas should work more as intended

	++ General Updates
		- Added field `canSSGApproach`.
		- Added field `_gamemode`.
		- Added method `IsServerRunning`.
			--> Various methods use this. Notably the "sends" which rely on the NetServer running to not crash.
		- Added method `ResetForRoundStart`.
		- Added method `UpdateSSGWarningTime`.
		- Added method `HandleClientDisconnect`.
		- Added method `SendTeammateDisconnected`.
		- Added method `UpdateDownedPlayers`.
		- Added method `RevivePlayer`.
		- Added method `HandlePlayerDied`.
		- Renamed field `_playerList` to `_players`.
		- Renamed field `_weaponsList` to `_weapons`.
		- Renamed method `SendShotConfirmed` to `SendConfirmAttack`.
		- Renamed method `svu_SkunkGasRadius` to `UpdateSafezoneRadius`.
		- Removed field `_nextGasWarnTimerCheck`.
		- Updated method `CheckSkunkGas`.
		- Updated method `UpdateLobbyCountdown`.
		- Updated method `UpdateSafezoneRadius`.
		- Fixed method `TryIndexFromConnection`.
			--> Was returning the PlayerID as opposed to their index... Should work just fine now!
	
	++ Message Handles
		- Msg5 (ReadyReceive) handle method `HandleReadyReceived` updated.
			--> Little cleanup; sets player.isReady field; uses player.Teammates to handle teammodes!
			--> Everyone has fills on! Redo incoming connections to make this work properly.
		- Msg11 (LobbyPositionUpdate) method renamed to `SendLobbyPlayerPositions`.
		- Msg12 (MatchPositionUpdate) method renamed to `SendMatchPlayerPositions`.
		- Msg14 (HandlePlayerPosUpdate) method updated to handle downed-players.
		- Msg15 (PlayerDied) send method `SendPlayerDeath` added.
		- Msg18 (AttackConfirm) handle method updated a little.

		- Msg85 (MapMark) send method `SendMapMarked` added.
		- Msg112 (CurrentPlayerPings) send method `SendCurrentPlayerPings` updated.

+------------------------------------------------------
	-- 1/31/23 --

Match:
	>> Most message message hanldes moved to separate methods to clean up `HandleMessage()`.

			--> Basically a simplification of "if (TryFindPlayer){} else: DC Player" that was everywhere.
		- Added method `ValidWeaponIndex`.
		- Added method `SendCancelReload`. (cannot use to force-cancel reloads; that's a limitation of the game)

		- Update message handles for MsgIDs: `36`, `38`, and `40`.
	
	++ Commands
		- Added method `TryPlayerFromString` (TPFS) to get Players from strings. Uses TryPlayerFromID/Name internally.
		- Updated /forceland to use TryPlayerFromString.

	++ Oopsies Section
		- Msg97 (DUMMY!) handle wasn't using SendDummy method, even though it already existed for the UpdateThread.

|    -- 1/1/23 #1 --
|
|--- Main Changes of Interest
|- Added 'ConfigLoader.cs' to load config files!
|   -- Bit over complicated. Would like to improve loading keys, but not quite sure of the best way how
|- Added a 'Match' constructor which takes a only 'ConfigLoader' parameter
|   -- Hopefully makes making silly edits to healing and stuff a lot easier; so can enjoy doing random custom stuff
|- Added field 'Match._serverkey' so the ConnectionApproval key isn't hard-coded anymore.
|- Added more configurable fields '_campfireHealPer', '_campfireHealRateSeconds' and '_coconutHeal'.
|   -- Hoping all instances of the hard-coded values were edited to now use the fields, but sure some were missed.
+------------------------------------------------------
    
+------------------------------------------------------
|    -- 12/31/22 #2 --
|
|--- Main Changes of Interest
|- Added 'Campfire.cs'; which allows for the addition of Campfires.
|   -- Everything seems to work properly. Will have to edit this when actually handling Player landing, bc right now players can activate them while landing
|- Added field '_campfires' to Match.
|- Added field 'NextCampfireTime' to Player.
|- Added field 'hasLanded' to Player.
|   -- Awaiting implementation elsewhere. Kind of needs to be implemented everywhere though which stinks. Notably right now is for campfires though.
|- Added methods 'CheckCampfiresLobby()' and 'CheckCampfiresMatch()' to Match.
|- Match will now load all campfires from the level data file into '_campfires'.
|
|- Updated .gitignore to ignore all stuff from datafiles.
+------------------------------------------------------

+------------------------------------------------------
|    -- 12/31/22 #1 --
|
|--- Main Changes of Interest
|- Field 'Match._playerJSONdata' has been replaced with _playerData.
|- Added field 'Match._bannedPlayers'.
|- Added field 'Match._bannedIPs'.
|   -- All of these have to do with the new and improved data json format, which was heavily based on Minecraft's. At least the general format.
|   -- As of now... Although the files are auto generated if they don't yet exist, inputting data has to be done yourself. This shouldn't be too...
|   ...difficult as the has been updated to show you how it is done. Otherwise, just in 'Match.cs' for references to the above fields.
|- Added method 'Match.LoadJSONArray()' to load JSONArrays
|   -- It's incredibly simple, and really doesn't scale the best, but it works. Should be noted that traversing the arrays seemed fast despite large sizes.
|   -- For both banlists, a 14.8mb file with ~300k entries was loaded. At the time of both being used ~300mb of memory was used by the program.
|   -- So indeed the scaling stinks! As long as the lists are short, everything is OK-enough for now.
|- Added 'Vector2.ValidDistance' along with the read-only property 'magnitudeSquared'.
|   -- 'ValidDistance' helps when wanting to find the distance between two vectors without having tons of duplicate code in 'Match.cs'.
|   -- 'magnitudeSquare' should help elsewhere; but currently only used in 'ValidDistance()'
|   -- NOTE: 'ValidDistance()' can return return the square-root distance if want, but 'Match.cs' only uses the squared-distance right now (it's faster).
|- Replaced 'Coconut.x' and 'Coconut.y' with 'Coconut.Position', which is a Vector2.
|
|- Updated 'README.md'.
|   -- Not quite sure what all to write, but hope it's in a more acceptable state than it was before.
|
|- Updated and renamed 'Match.sendAuthenticationResponseToClient()' to 'HandleAuthenticationRequest()'
|   -- Should reflect the naming scheme better. IMPORTANT: The method now uses 'Match._bannedPlayers' to search for players with banned PlayFabIDs.
|   -- PlayFabIDs will now also print to the console for in the event you want to add someone to the Banned-Players list.
|- Updated `ConnectionApproval` in the Match's netloop to search for banned IPs before reading the ClientKey.
|- Updated 'Match.serverHandlePlayerConnection()' to utilize Match's updated PlayerData field.
|- Updated and renamed 'Match.serverSendCoconutEaten()' to 'Match.HandleCoconutRequest()'.
|   -- Now uses the new 'Vector2.ValidDistance()' function!
|
|--- Oopsies Section
|- Molecrate was checking if the Player was over the threshold, not *within*. Threshold also increased from 14.5 to 14.7 for good measure.
|   -- Maybe caused by messing way too much with git histories, or just forgot to fix it.
|   -- Figured if it was tested and the tests passed, then over 14.5 is a reasonable value. So the threshold has been increased from 14.5 to 14.7 for now.

|--- Other Comments / Potential Tasks for next time
|- Git history is wacky!! WHY???
|   -- Kind of maybe messed way too hard with trying to clean up git history, and maybe accidentally overwrote the last 3 months worth of history... Sorry...
|- Thinking of trying to do campfires soon now that Vector2 is a thing and also has a distance calculation built in.
|   -- Although, fair warning: campfires probably won't be super accurate as the distance is just an estimate :[
|- Would maybe try adding bananas, but that requires throwables to work- which was hoping to make overhaul LootItems first as well. So not quite sure yet!
+------------------------------------------------------
    
+------------------------------------------------------
|    -- 12/28/22 #1 --
|
|--- Main Changes of Interest
|- The network loop in Match has been moved to its own separate thread.
|   -- Hopefully clears up the constructor a little bit... Although it'll be pretty messy again soon.
|- Added struct `Vector2`.
|   -- Basically Unity's Vector2 struct. Needed it for a while, and it helps with the Molecrate.
|- Added class `MoleCrate`.
|   -- Mole crates have been added to the game! Still haven't agreed on how to actually write it! But it's here!
|   -- While the Match does handle the Molecrate "correctly", the Molecrate does not yet randomly spawn, nor does opening it give any players items.
|- Added fields `_moleSpawnSpots`, `_maxMoleCrates`, and `_moleCrates` to Match.
|   -- This is so the Match can actually handle mole crates.
|- Added method `CheckMoleCrates()` to Match.
|- Added command `/mole` to Match to test out Molecrate.
|   -- Doesn't take any parameters. The path is hard-coded, but changing it does seem to handle correctly.
|   -- Tried simplifying the reading of `weaponClass` key. Also throws exceptions now
|
|--- Oopsies Section
|- Reminder that this project is also Github learning expierence.
|   -- Messing around with stuff probably shouldn't leading to some wacky stuf like strange commit histories.
+------------------------------------------------------

+------------------------------------------------------
|    -- 12/26/22 #1 --
|
|--- Main Changes of Interest
|- Match:
|   -- Renamed `serverSendPlayerShoteded()`  to `HandleAttackConfirm()`
|   -- Tried to simplify `HandleAttackConfirm()` to not be tons of nested `try{} catch()` / `if`s; but may be more confusing to read
|   -- `HandleAttackConfirm()` should now exit early if in lobby, attacking player is dead, or the target player is either dead or godmoded
|   -- Renamed `serverSendShotInfo()` to `SendShotConfirmed()`.
|   -- New method `SendExitVehicle()` to make sending hamsterball exit messages easier
|   -- Moved `Match.GetAllGunsList()` to `Weapon` class.
|   -- Set `Match._availableIDs` to have an initial capacity of `Match._playerList.Length`.
|       --- This so all X number of IDs are available rather than a set 64.
|   -- Set `Match._incomingConnections` to have an initial capacity of 4.
|       --- Perhaps didn't need this as it would get resized anyways, but this should be fine-enough!
|- Weapon:
|   -- Renamed `ArmorDamageOverride` to `VehicleDamageOverride` to reflect its intended use
|   -- Added `GetAllGunsList()` and `GetAllGunsList(Weapon[])`; although only the latter is used.
|   -- Updated `GetAllWeaponsList()` to try and start where the executing assembly is located. Also throws exceptions now. Should likely handle these.
|   -- Tried simplifying the reading of `weaponClass` key. Also throws exceptions now
|
|--- Oopsies Section
|- Set Match._playerList default size back to 64 (from 1).
|   -- The value of 1 was only intended to test whether the match was full or not. Even then, that wasn't finished so oopsies :[
+------------------------------------------------------


+------------------------------------------------------

|- Tagged 'SkunkGasWarningDuration' as PRIVATE.
|- Added command "/god" and alternative '/godmode' to enable/disable Godmode.
|- Improved test_damagePlayer() to check if the Player is God Moded AND whether or not they're actually alive.
|- Added 'TryPlayerFromName' to try and get Player objects from Match._playerList by Username.
|- Attempted to improve upon '/kill' so it is no longer just a glorified test of the KillAnnounce message type.
|   -- It is now a glorified test of 'test_damagePlayer()' and 'TryPlayerFromName' instead.
|
|- Player fields renamed as well
|   -- Renamed "sender" to "Sender".
|   -- Renamed "myID" to simply "ID".

|
|- Other:
|   -- Tried moving `MersenneTwister` to SARStuff.
|
|--- Other Comments / Potential Tasks for next time
|- Noticed there is a `MessageReceivedEvent` property for NetServer. Could/should maybe use this to block Match main thread for until a message is received.
|- HandleAttackWindUp/Down could maybe use more work?
|- HandleHamsterballBounce needs more work.
+------------------------------------------------------



+------------------------------------------------------
|    -- 12/22/22 #1 --
|
|--- Changes of Interest
|- RNG Seeds have been set back to hard-coded values and are no longer randomly generated.
|   -- This is to make testing a little bit easier right now.
|- Added "ServerHandleLobbyLootRequest()" to allow players to pickup GalleryWeapons (still needs some work!).
|- Added "m_SafeMode" so there can be safe/nonsafe things (default = TRUE).
|- Added "/safemode" command which toggles "m_SafeMode".
|- Added "/gun" ""command"" to make gun testing easier. 
|- Added "GetAllGunsList()" which returns a Weapon-object array that only has Gun-Type Weapons.
|
|- Renamed "GSH_PlayerLootRequest" to "ServerHandleMatchLootRequest()".
|- Renamed ""GSH_AttackWindup()"" to "serverHandleAttackWindUp()".
|- Improved "serverHandleAttackWindUp()".
|    -- Try/Catch in case of error.
|    -- NetConnection will be dropped if 1) Sends Msg74 while NOT in the PlayerList; 2) Are in a match, calls the method and they DON'T have the right WeaponID in the Slot
|    -->> Potentially need to check if the Weapon given can actually be wound-up, but right now this all seems to be cool!
|- Improved ``/list`` so now it works properly.
|
|--- Oopsies Section
|- (last commit) Commented out uses of "serverSendShotInfo()" in sections relating to the Dartgun.
|    -- This should fix the double-hit sound playing for those who hit people with DDG.
|- Accidently replaced the "if" statement in the Lobby-Countdown check with a "while" loop. The correct one should be replaced now.
|    -- This was meant to be the "if" statement in the MatchStarted loop, which wanted to be changed to a "while" like in the NotMatchStarted section
|
|--- Other Comments / Potential Tasks for next time
|- In general renaming things so everything is more consistent, would be nice.
|- Changes like Player.myID to Player.ID is likely to be taking place soon.
|- Ammo is still not tracked, which is waiting on the LootItems rework to be done. Maybe added at the same time.
|- Grenades and such are in a similar boat, in which they are not properly tracked because LootItems is too messy!
|
|- A rework to the command system as a whole would be quite nice. Not sure how to accomplish this right now.
