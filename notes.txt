+------------------------------------------------------
|    -- 12/28/22 #1 --
|
|--- Main Changes of Interest
|- The network loop in Match has been moved to its own separate thread.
|   -- Hopefully clears up the constructor a little bit... Although it'll be pretty messy again soon.
|- Added struct `Vector2`.
|   -- Basically Unity's Vector2 struct. Needed it for a while, and it helps with the Molecrate.
|- Added class `MoleCrate`.
|   -- Mole crates have been added to the game! Still haven't agreed on how to actually write it! But it's here!
|   -- While the Match does handle the Molecrate "correctly", the Molecrate does not yet randomly spawn, nor does opening it give any players items.
|- Added fields `_moleSpawnSpots`, `_maxMoleCrates`, and `_moleCrates` to Match.
|   -- This is so the Match can actually handle mole crates.
|- Added method `CheckMoleCrates()` to Match.
|- Added command `/mole` to Match to test out Molecrate.
|   -- Doesn't take any parameters. The path is hard-coded, but changing it does seem to handle correctly.
|   -- Tried simplifying the reading of `weaponClass` key. Also throws exceptions now
|
|--- Oopsies Section
|- Reminder that this project is also Github learning expierence.
|   -- Messing around with stuff probably shouldn't leading to some wacky stuf like strange commit histories.

|    -- 12/26/22 #1 --
|
|--- Main Changes of Interest
|- Match:
|   -- Renamed `serverSendPlayerShoteded()`  to `HandleAttackConfirm()`
|   -- Tried to simplify `HandleAttackConfirm()` to not be tons of nested `try{} catch()` / `if`s; but may be more confusing to read
|   -- `HandleAttackConfirm()` should now exit early if in lobby, attacking player is dead, or the target player is either dead or godmoded
|   -- Renamed `serverSendShotInfo()` to `SendShotConfirmed()`.
|   -- New method `SendExitVehicle()` to make sending hamsterball exit messages easier
|   -- Moved `Match.GetAllGunsList()` to `Weapon` class.
|   -- Set `Match._availableIDs` to have an initial capacity of `Match._playerList.Length`.
|       --- This so all X number of IDs are available rather than a set 64.
|   -- Set `Match._incomingConnections` to have an initial capacity of 4.
|       --- Perhaps didn't need this as it would get resized anyways, but this should be fine-enough!
|- Weapon:
|   -- Renamed `ArmorDamageOverride` to `VehicleDamageOverride` to reflect its intended use
|   -- Added `GetAllGunsList()` and `GetAllGunsList(Weapon[])`; although only the latter is used.
|   -- Updated `GetAllWeaponsList()` to try and start where the executing assembly is located. Also throws exceptions now. Should likely handle these.
|   -- Tried simplifying the reading of `weaponClass` key. Also throws exceptions now
|
|--- Oopsies Section
|- Set Match._playerList default size back to 64 (from 1).
|   -- The value of 1 was only intended to test whether the match was full or not. Even then, that wasn't finished so oopsies :[

|- Added 'TryPlayerFromName' to try and get Player objects from Match._playerList by Username.
|- Attempted to improve upon '/kill' so it is no longer just a glorified test of the KillAnnounce message type.
|   -- It is now a glorified test of 'test_damagePlayer()' and 'TryPlayerFromName' instead.
|

|   -- Renamed "myID" to simply "ID".
|   -- Renamed "myName" to simply "Name".

|
|- Other:
|   -- Tried moving `MersenneTwister` to SARStuff.
|
|--- Other Comments / Potential Tasks for next time
|- Noticed there is a `MessageReceivedEvent` property for NetServer. Could/should maybe use this to block Match main thread for until a message is received.
|- HandleAttackWindUp/Down could maybe use more work?
|- HandleHamsterballBounce needs more work.

|    -- 12/22/22 #1 --
|
|--- Changes of Interest
|- RNG Seeds have been set back to hard-coded values and are no longer randomly generated.
|   -- This is to make testing a little bit easier right now.
|- Added "ServerHandleLobbyLootRequest()" to allow players to pickup GalleryWeapons (still needs some work!).
|- Added "m_SafeMode" so there can be safe/nonsafe things (default = TRUE).
|- Added "/safemode" command which toggles "m_SafeMode".
|- Added "/gun" ""command"" to make gun testing easier. 
|- Added "GetAllGunsList()" which returns a Weapon-object array that only has Gun-Type Weapons.
|
|- Renamed "GSH_PlayerLootRequest" to "ServerHandleMatchLootRequest()".
|- Renamed ""GSH_AttackWindup()"" to "serverHandleAttackWindUp()".
|- Improved "serverHandleAttackWindUp()".
|    -- Try/Catch in case of error.
|    -- NetConnection will be dropped if 1) Sends Msg74 while NOT in the PlayerList; 2) Are in a match, calls the method and they DON'T have the right WeaponID in the Slot
|    -->> Potentially need to check if the Weapon given can actually be wound-up, but right now this all seems to be cool!
|- Improved ``/list`` so now it works properly.
|
|--- Oopsies Section
|- (last commit) Commented out uses of "serverSendShotInfo()" in sections relating to the Dartgun.
|    -- This should fix the double-hit sound playing for those who hit people with DDG.
|- Accidently replaced the "if" statement in the Lobby-Countdown check with a "while" loop. The correct one should be replaced now.
|    -- This was meant to be the "if" statement in the MatchStarted loop, which wanted to be changed to a "while" like in the NotMatchStarted section
|
|--- Other Comments / Potential Tasks for next time
|- In general renaming things so everything is more consistent, would be nice.
|- Changes like Player.myID to Player.ID is likely to be taking place soon.
|- Ammo is still not tracked, which is waiting on the LootItems rework to be done. Maybe added at the same time.
|- Grenades and such are in a similar boat, in which they are not properly tracked because LootItems is too messy!
|
|- A rework to the command system as a whole would be quite nice. Not sure how to accomplish this right now.
